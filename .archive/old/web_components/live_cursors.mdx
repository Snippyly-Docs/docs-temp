import { Cursor } from '@snippyly/snippyly-demo-component'
import { documentID } from '../../../components/documentID'
import SplitPane from '../../../components/SplitPane';
import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

export const cursorDocumentId = documentID("cursor");

<SplitPane>
  <Cursor type={1} documentId={cursorDocumentId}/>
  <Cursor type={0} documentId={cursorDocumentId}/>
</SplitPane>

## 1: Add the component

```html copy
<snippyly-cursor></snippyly-cursor>
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The `snippyly-cursor` component needs to be in the root App component of your React app
</Callout>

## 2: Customization

### Style the component

Simply add a CSS class to the component to give it a style.

**Example**

```html copy
<snippyly-cursor class="my-custom-css"></snippyly-cursor>
```

```css copy
snippyly-cursor.my-custom-css {
  /* Custom CSS */
}
```

You can also pass your own CSS class to the inner DOM element of the cursor label using the property **`label-class`**.

**Example**

```html copy
<snippyly-cursor label-class="my-custom-label-class"></snippyly-cursor>
```

```css copy
snippyly-cursor .my-custom-label-class {
  /* Custom CSS */
}
```

### Set inactivity time

By default if the user is inactive for `>2 minutes`, we mark them offline. By inactive we mean they haven't moved their mouse or haven't made any keyboard event. You can configure this default threshold as follows:

**Example**
```js copy
const cursorElement = Velt.getCursorElement();
cursorElement.setInactivityTime(60000); // Pass time in milliseconds
```

### Restrict cursors to specific DOM elements

By default, your end-users can see other users' cursors on **any** DOM element when they are on the same page (`documentID`). In some scenarios you may want to restrict the cursor viability to only certain areas of your UI. For eg: if your app has a canvas and a bunch of tool panels, you can now restrict cursors to only the canvas. There is not a lot of value in showing users' cursors on the tools panel.

You can restrict cursors to specific DOM elements by providing a list of element ids where the feature should be allowed. Note if you pass an empty array, users can see each others' cursors on the entire DOM.

**Example**

```js copy
const cursorElement = Velt.getCursorElement();
cursorElement.allowedElementIds(['elementId1', 'elementId2']);
```

### Enable avatar mode

By default, we show the User's name in the cursor label, you can replace it with the User's avatar instead. You can do so by setting `avatar-mode="true"` attribute on the `<snippyly-cursor>` element.

**Example**

```html copy
<snippyly-cursor avatar-mode="true"></snippyly-cursor>
```
