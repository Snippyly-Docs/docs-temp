# Presence

_Display which users are currently in the same Location._

---

<SplitPane>
  <Presence user={"Rachel"} documentId={presenceDocumentId}/>
  <Presence user={"Ross"} documentId={presenceDocumentId}/>
</SplitPane>

## 1: Add the component

```html copy
<snippyly-presence></snippyly-presence>
```

<Callout type="info">Insert the component anywhere in your application!</Callout>

## 2: Customization

### Style the component

Simply target the component to give it a style.

**Example**

```html copy
<snippyly-presence></snippyly-presence>
```

```css copy
snippyly-presence {
  /* Custom CSS */
}
```

We've provided CSS parts for you to target each individual part at a more granular level.

**Example**

```css copy
snippyly-presence::part(container) {
  /* Custom CSS */
}

snippyly-presence::part(user-avatar) {
  /* Custom CSS */
}
```

### Set max avatars

**Default:** Maximum 5 user avatars will be visible in `<snippyly-presence>`. If there are more than 5 online users, it will show `+ remaining_number` at the end.

You can configure this by setting `max-users="count"` attribute in `<snippyly-presence>` component.

**Example**

```html copy
<snippyly-presence max-users="2"></snippyly-presence>
```

### Add presence for locations

There are some apps where there are locations within the main document eg: Google Slides, where each slide represents a different location on the document.

By default, `<snippyly-presence>` will show all online users in the given document.  
However, if you also want to show who is online at a child document level, then you can add another `<snippyly-presence>` in your child document and pass a `location` object in the `location` attribute of `<snippyly-presence>` tag.

For this feature, you need to first call `setLocation(location)` in the child document and pass the same `location` object to `<snippyly-presence>` as `string` using `JSON.stringify(location)`.

**Example**

```html copy
<snippyly-presence location="location"></snippyly-presence>
```

### Set inactivity time

By default if the user is inactive for `>5 minutes`, we mark them offline. By inactive we mean they haven't moved their mouse or haven't made any keyboard event. You can configure this default threshold as follows:

**Example**

```js
const presenceElement = client.getPresenceElement();
presenceElement.setInactivityTime(60000); // Pass time in milliseconds
```

You can also set the inactivity time easily by passing it as a property:

```html
<snippyly-presence inactivity-time="60000"></snippyly-presence>
```

### Enable follow-along mode

We provide a convenient "follow-along" mode that allows you to follow along with other users by clicking on their user avatar in the presence container. You can enable this feature by:

**Example**

```js
const presenceElement = client.getPresenceElement();
presenceElement.enableFollowAlongMode();
```

### Dark mode

To set dark mode on only the Presence component, just add the `dark` attribute.

```html
<snippyly-presence dark></snippyly-presence>
```
