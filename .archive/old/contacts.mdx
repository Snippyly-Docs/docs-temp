# Contacts

_How to group users together for tagging purposes._

---

## 1: Group ID

When you give a `groupId` to a user by calling the `identify` or `updateUser` method, you are placing that user within a group.

- All users in the same group will be able to see each other when tagging, assigning, commenting, etc.
- If you change a user's group ID, the SDK will preserve the contacts they had previously

**Example**

```js copy
client.identify({
  userId: "some_user_uuid",
  name: "Peter Parker",
  email: "peter@superheroes.com",
  groupId: 1
});
```

## 2: Contacts list

You can also pass a `contacts` array of [UserContact]() objects when calling `identify` or `updateUser`. This list is a _private_ list of contacts that are specific to that user, and remain unaffected by any changes to the **Group ID**.

**Example**

```js copy {5-10}
client.identify({
  userId: "some_user_uuid",
  name: "Peter Parker",
  email: "peter@superheroes.com",
  contacts: [
    {
      name: "Mary Jane",
      email: "mjane@spidertalent.com"
    }
  ]
});
```

## 3: Removing contacts
