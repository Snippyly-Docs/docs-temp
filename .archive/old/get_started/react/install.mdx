# Installation

_Install the React-specific SDK library._

---

## 1: Install the Velt SDK

You can use your preferred package manager instead to install **Velt**, but here's an example using `npm`:

```sh copy
npm install @veltdev/react
```

<Callout type="info">
  <p>Don't have an app yet? Create a sample React app by pasting the following in your terminal:</p>
  ```sh copy
  npx create-react-app snip-demo && cd snip-demo && npm install @snippyly/sdk && npm start
  ```
</Callout>

## 2: Install the Velt types (optional)

Installing types will give you access to autocompletion and other neat features! We highly recommend that you install the **Velt** type definitions.

```sh copy
npm install --save-dev @snippyly/types
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed the **Velt** SDK, you can move on to [configure your installation](/learn/get_started/configuration)!
