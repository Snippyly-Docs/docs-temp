# Configuration

_Learn how to unlock the most out of the SDK._

---

## 1. Authentication

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">Don't have an API key? Get one here!</Callout>

First, you need to initialize the **SnippylyProvider** with a client authentication token. If you don't have one, go ahead and [visit our website]() to sign up! Insert the **SnipplyProvider** in the _root of your application_.

First import the `SnipplyProvider`:

```js copy
import { SnippylyProvider } from '@veltdev/react';
```

Then you can add it to your HTML with your API key:

```html copy
<React.StrictMode>
  <SnippylyProvider apiKey="API_KEY">
    <App />
  </SnippylyProvider>
</React.StrictMode>
```

The **SnippylyProvider** acts as a [React context provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), so you can only use the **Velt Client** within its context.

### Configuring the Client

The **SnippylyProvider** also takes a `config` property to restrict certain features. Here's how to restrict **Velt** features to a certain URL:

```jsx copy {3-5}
<SnippylyProvider
  apiKey="API_KEY"
  config={{
    urlAllowList: ['/review']
  }}
>
```

You can view the reference [here]() to check out all the different configuration options available.

## 2. Using the Velt Client

The `@veltdev/react` package provides a convenient hook `useVeltClient` to provision the SDK client.

First import the `SnipplyClient`:

```js copy
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';
```

Then you can use the provided hook to fetch an instance of the client:

```js copy
const { client } = useSnipplyClient();
```

To test the client out, we can add a `useEffect` hook to our component and log the `client.version` property. Within your React component, create a new effect:

```js copy
useEffect(() => {
  if (client) {
    console.log(client.version);
  }
}, [client]);
```

This effect simply checks if the client has been provisioned, and logs the current SDK version to the console. Here is what the full example looks like in context:

```js copy
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';

function SomeComponent() {

  const { client } = useVeltClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (client) {
      console.log(client.version);
    }
  }, [client]);

  return ();
}
```

When your component is rendered, you should verify for yourself that the **Velt** SDK is _loaded, working, and on the intended version_. Note that when using the **Velt** client in a React effect, it is a general best practice to check if the client is `undefined`.

## 3. Identifying your Users

**Velt** needs to know who is logged in to your application! This is so we can accurately provide cursors, presence, comments, etc.

### _When should I identify users?_

> **You must identify the user every time the SDK is loaded on the browser for the first time.**
> For example, when a new session/tab is created you must re-identify the user.

Everyone handles authentication differently in their applications, so there isn't a one size fits all solution. The main point is that _when the user is logged in_, you should also identify the user with the **Velt** client.

### Example with Firebase Authentication

Let's walk through a specific example using Firebase Authentication. Here's some typical Firebase code you would find in a React application:

```js copy
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const app = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = firebase.auth(app);
const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();

export const signInWithGoogle = () => {
  return auth.signInWithPopup(provider);
};
```

The code snippet above initializes the Firebase SDK. **This code example is not important** -- all you need to know is that the code exports a function `signInWithGoogle` that we will be using in our example below.

First import the `useVeltClient` hook as well as the `signInWithGoogle` function we defined in the Firebase code.

```js copy
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';
import { signInWithGoogle } from '../firebase';
```

Second, we add a button to our React component that calls a handler function `signInHandler`:

```jsx copy
return (
  <button onClick={ signInHandler }>Log in with Google</button>
);
```

Within our component, provision an instance of the **Velt** client:

```js copy {6}
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';
import { signInWithGoogle } from '../firebase';

function LoginComponent() {

  const { client } = useVeltClient();

  return (
    <button onClick={ signInHandler }>Log in with Google</button>
  );
}
```

Lastly, we can define the function `signInHandler`. This function calls the `signInWithGoogle` function we made earlier, which prompts the user to login via Google. If the user is logged in successfully, we identify the user using the `identify` function provided by the **Velt** client:

```js copy
const signInHandler = async () => {
  try {
    const credentials = await signInWithGoogle();
    if (credentials.user === null) return;
    if (!client) return;

    const snippylyUser = {
      userId: credentials.user.userInfo.uid,
      name: credentials.user.userInfo.displayName,
      email: credentials.user.userInfo.email,
      photoUrl: credentials.user.userInfo.photoURL
    };
    const res = await client.identify(snippylyUser);
    // Success!
  } catch (err) {
    // Do something with the error!
    console.log(err);
  }
};
```

The `identify` function accepts a [User]() as its only parameter. If your authentication method provides user data, you may have to map that data to our **Velt** [User]() object like in our Firebase example:

```js copy
const snippylyUser = {
  userId: credentials.user.userInfo.uid,
  name: credentials.user.userInfo.displayName,
  email: credentials.user.userInfo.email,
  photoUrl: credentials.user.userInfo.photoURL
};
```

Keep in mind this is only one method of logging the user in, and you will have to decide where to identify the user in your _specific_ application. Here's the full example in context:

```js copy
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';
import { signInWithGoogle } from '../firebase';

function LoginComponent() {

  const { client } = useVeltClient();

  const signInHandler = async () => {
    try {
      const credentials = await signInWithGoogle();
      if (credentials.user === null) return;
      if (!client) return;

      const snippylyUser = {
        userId: credentials.user.userInfo.uid,
        name: credentials.user.userInfo.displayName,
        email: credentials.user.userInfo.email,
        photoUrl: credentials.user.userInfo.photoURL
      };

      client.identify(snippylyUser);
      // Success!
    } catch (err) {
      // Do something with the error!
      console.log(err);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={ signInHandler }>Log in with Google</button>
  );
}
```

Be sure to check out the reference, specifically the [User]() and the [Client]() to see exactly what's available to you.

### Signing Out

Signing the user out is extremely simple. Just add this function call to your logout code:

```js copy
client.signOutUser();
```

The `signOutUser` function returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), so you can use it with `async/await`.

## 4. Tracking the User

Lastly, Velt needs to know what part of your app the user is currently on! **Documents** and **Locations** are how you can provide that information.

### Setting the Document ID

A **Document** is like a _Building_. Users in the same **Document** can interact with each other. A **Document** can be represented with a string identifier.

Here, we will set our **Document ID**, which is like setting the address of the building that the current user is in.

```js copy {7-11}
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';

function SomeComponent() {

  const { client } = useVeltClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (client) {
      client.setDocumentID('some_document_id');
    }
  }, [client]);

  return ();
}
```

In this example, we use a React effect to set the **Document ID** to the string `some_document_id`. Now, if two users are online, and also in the same **Document** `some_document_id`, they should be able to interact with each other using our [pre-made web components]().

### Setting the Location

> If a **Document** is like a building, what are the rooms?

A **Location** is like a _Room_. Users in the same room can talk to each other, see each other, and interact in real-time! **Locations** are _completely optional_, you can opt to use them or not. If you opt to use **Locations**, users in the same **Document** must also be in the same **Location** now to interact. A **Location** can be described using any plain JSON object.

> What if I don't set the **Document**?

Your user won't be able to interact with _anyone_!

> What if I don't want to use **Locations**?

If the complexity of your application does not require the use of **Locations**, you can use **Documents** by themselves to group your users together.

Here, we will set the **Document ID** as well as the **Location**.

```js copy {7-11}
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';

function SomeComponent() {

  const { client } = useVeltClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (client) {
      client.setDocumentID('some_document_id');
      client.setLocation({id: 1});
    }
  }, [client]);

  return ();
}
```

In this example, we set the **Document ID** as `some_document_id`, and the **Location** to an object with an ID property and value of `1`. _If you specify a **Location**_, users in the same **Document** will no longer be able to interact if they are not also in the same **Location**.


### Multiple Locations

One neat feature of **Locations** is that the user can actually be in multiple locations at once!

**Example**

```js copy {10-11}
import { useVeltClient } from '@veltdev/react';

function SomeComponent() {

  const { client } = useVeltClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (client) {
      client.setDocumentID('some_document_id');
      client.addLocation({id: 1});
      client.addLocation({id: 2});
    }
  }, [client]);

  return ();
}
```

In this example, the user will have access to both location 1 and location 2!

### Location data attributes

If you don't want to use JS to set the client location, you can alternatively use data attributes. Add the `data-snippyly-location` attribute to the top level of an element where you want to set the custom location object.

**Example**

```html copy {4}
<div class="container">
  // If you want to add comments to location {"key1": "value1"}, if it is added inside below div
  // then add location attribute to below div as mentioned here
  <div class="sub-container" data-snippyly-location='{"key1": "value1"}'>
    <div class="card">
      ... any content ...
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** Make sure that you are converting object to string before setting it to location attribute.
</Callout>

## 5. Extra User Configurations

{/* <Callout type="info">Don't want to read about more configuration? Move on to some of our basic concepts [here]()!</Callout> */}

There are some extra configurations to the `User` that you can make that will help you unlock the most value out of the SDK. 

### Contacts

When identifying the user, you can provide a list of [UserContact]() entries that we will use to map those contacts to that particular user. For example:

```js copy {5-10}
client.identify({
  userId: "some_user_uuid",
  name: "Peter Parker",
  email: "peter@superheroes.com",
  contacts: [
    {
      name: "Mary Jane",
      email: "mjane@spidertalent.com"
    }
  ]
});
```

If you identify the user **Peter Parker** like in the example above, that user will now be able to tag **Mary Jane** _(mjane@spidertalent.com)_ in comments!

<Callout type="info">Read more about tags and contacts [here]().</Callout>

### Updating the User

At any time, if you need to update the user's data, you can use the `updateUser` function available on the **Velt** client:

```js copy
client.updateUser({userId: "some_user_uuid"});
```

If you provide a different UUID than the original user, the client will re-initialize with that new user. Check out the [User]() reference to check out what fields you can update.
